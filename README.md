Dashboard
=========

This project is inspired by the (soon-to-be-shutdown) iGoogle page.
It contains a simple static html page and some css magic to make it look a little bit better.
(Also i have started the javascript stuff using jquery ui.)

This will later become a simple and configurable couchapp (see couchdb),
that will be extendable with all kinds of widgets like rss readers.
